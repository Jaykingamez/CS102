Test Cases will be carried out with three possible flows: 

1. Simple tests 
For testing specific classes. Returns true if passed and shows expected vs actual values: kinda like in lab tests!

- Hand tests 
- Bankrupt test 
- Bot decisions test 
- Basic game mechanics (like adding new player etc) 
- Role test 
- Turn functionality

2. Bot games
- Bot decisions 
- Game with 1 or more bots. Hard code different roles 

3. Full run tests
- As the name suggests
