A simple Poker Game based on Texas Holdem with a twist—where every player has unique roles and special abilities. May the best player emerge victorious!

# How to use
To run the application, you’ll need Java JDK 21. If you haven’t already, you can install it [here.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html) Follow these steps:
1. **Compile Source Files**: Execute compile.bat to compile all the Java source files. The compiled class files will be automatically stored in the classes directory.
2. **Start the Game**: Run run.bat to launch your application. 

# Project Structure

- **src**: Contains all the Java source files.
- **classes**: After running compile.bat, this directory holds the compiled class files.
- **images**: If your application uses any image files, they should be placed here (though it’ll be empty for a console application).
- **lib** (if using external libraries): Store any jar files you’re using for your project.
- **compile.bat** Compiles all Java source files and stores in classes directory.
- **run.bat** Runs Java application
